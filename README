# Documentation Glue

Each file's name (without the .json extension) is a scope selector.

The root element is an array of objects. Each object represents a specific search provider, and may have the following keys:

    name: The name to display in the documentation viewer's menu
    home: A home page to display when no query is present
    search: A search url. %% is used as a place holder for the user's query.
